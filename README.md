# Space Invaders

##  Basic Mechanics
* This game was inspired by the classic arcade game Space Invaders. Ten aliens are spawned in at the top of the screen, each ten representing one "wave" of monsters. The user plays as the space ship at the bottom of the screen, and can only move left and right, not up nor down. By pressing SPACE, the user can shoot bullets (only one at a time) at the aliens, and if the shot connects then the respective alien dies. If all of the aliens are killed, that wave is cleared and another ten aliens are immediately spawned after, starting the next wave. Each enemy can also shoot once every second, and if that bullet hits the player then its game over. 
##  The Danger Zone
* Each alien moves at a set speed, and once an alien reaches the end of the screen, only that alien is moved down one level, not the entire wave. The red line at the bottom of the player's screen represents the "danger zone" that the aliens are to stay away from. If a single alien moves beyond that line, then the player loses and the game is over.
